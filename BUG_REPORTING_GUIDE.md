# Bug Reporting Guide

This guide helps you effectively report bugs, ensuring they can be quickly identified and resolved. Clear and detailed bug reports help maintainers swiftly address issues, contributing to the ongoing improvement and stability of Vedro.

Follow these steps to report a bug:

## 1. Identify the Correct Repository

1. **Core Framework**  
   If the bug relates to the primary Vedro functionality, visit the [Vedro](https://github.com/vedro-universe/vedro) core repo.
2. **Official Plugins**  
   Search for the plugin‚Äôs repository in the [Vedro Universe](https://github.com/orgs/vedro-universe/repositories) on GitHub.
3. **Community Plugins**  
   If it‚Äôs a community plugin (not in the Vedro Universe), check its own repo for instructions on reporting bugs.

## 2. Search Existing Issues

Before creating a new issue, check the repository‚Äôs ¬´Issues¬ª tab to see if the bug has already been reported. If you find a matching issue, you can add any additional details or a reaction (e.g., a thumbs-up üëç) to indicate you‚Äôre experiencing the same problem.

## 3. Create a New Issue

If you don‚Äôt see your bug listed, open a New Issue in the appropriate repository. Please include the following:
- **Descriptive Title**: Clearly summarize the issue.  
- **Environment**: Mention your OS, Python version, Vedro version, and any relevant plugins or dependencies.  
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Provide a minimal code snippet or test scenario, listing each step clearly.  
- **Expected vs Actual Behavior**: Explain what you expected to happen, and what actually occurred.  
- **Logs and Screenshots (Optional)**: Attach any relevant error messages, traceback logs, or screenshots.

**That‚Äôs it!** After submitting your issue, our team and community contributors will review it and might request further details. Your contributions help make Vedro more reliable and user-friendly.
