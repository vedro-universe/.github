# Bug Reporting Guide

Thank you for taking the time to report a bug! Well-documented bug reports help us address issues faster, ensuring Vedro continues to improve.

## 1. Identify the Correct Repository

1. **Core Framework**  
   If the bug relates to the primary Vedro functionality, visit the [Vedro](https://github.com/vedro-universe/vedro) core repo.
2. **Official Plugins**  
   Search for the plugin’s repository in the [Vedro Universe](https://github.com/orgs/vedro-universe/repositories) on GitHub.
3. **Community Plugins**  
   If it’s a community plugin (not in the Vedro Universe), check its own repo for instructions on reporting bugs.

## 2. Search Existing Issues

Before creating a new issue, look through the repository’s «Issues» tab to see if your bug has already been reported. If you find an existing issue:

- Add a comment with any extra details or logs you’ve discovered.
- React to the issue (e.g., using a thumbs-up) to show that you’re also experiencing it.

## 3. Create a New Issue

If you don’t see your bug listed, open a New Issue. Please include:

1. **Descriptive Title**  
   - Clearly summarize the bug, avoid titles like «Bug in Vedro» or «Issue with Plugin».

2. **Environment Details**  
   - **OS**: Windows, macOS, or Linux distribution  
   - **Python Version**: e.g., Python 3.10  
   - **Vedro/Plugin Version**: The specific version(s) you’re using  
   - Any other relevant dependencies or libraries

3. **Steps to Reproduce**  
   - Provide a minimal code snippet or test scenario that reliably triggers the bug.  
   - List each step clearly.

4. **Expected Behavior**  
   - Explain what you thought should happen after following the steps.

5. **Actual Behavior**  
   - Describe what actually happens, including any error messages or incorrect outputs.

6. **Screenshots or Logs (Optional)**  
   - If relevant, attach screenshots of console logs or error traces.  
   - Include any traceback or CLI output that might help pinpoint the issue.

## 4. Provide Additional Context

If the bug is related to a specific scenario (e.g., a certain OS version, a particular CI system, or an unusual project setup), describe the context. This information can help maintainers replicate your environment and confirm the root cause.

## 5. Follow Up and Collaborate

Once you’ve created an issue:

- Check back regularly: A maintainer or community member may ask for more information or clarification.
- Test fixes: If a pull request is opened to address the bug, you can try it out and confirm if it resolves the issue.

> **Tip**: Enable notifications on GitHub so you don’t miss any follow-up questions or comments.
