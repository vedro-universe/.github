# .github Organization Defaults  

This repository provides default community files (e.g., Code of Conduct, Contributing Guidelines) for all repositories in our organization. These defaults automatically apply to any repository that does not have its own copies.  

For more information, see [GitHubâ€™s documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file).
